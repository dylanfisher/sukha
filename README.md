# Sukha सुख

Happiness, pleasure, ease, pure bliss.

## Deploy To Kodi

Package the skin as a Kodi install ZIP and copy it to a Kodi box over SSH:

```bash
./scripts/deploy_kodi_zip.sh
```

By default this copies to `root@192.168.1.128:/storage/downloads`.

This creates `dist/skin.sukha-<version>.zip` with `skin.sukha/` at the top level, then copies it to the remote directory with `scp`.

On many LibreELEC/CoreELEC installs, `root@<kodi-ip>` and `/storage/downloads` are the right defaults. After copying, install it in Kodi with `Add-ons > Install from zip file`.

Override the host or destination directory if needed:

```bash
./scripts/deploy_kodi_zip.sh root@192.168.1.128 /storage/downloads
```
